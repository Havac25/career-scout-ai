## Project Vision

A Python application that scrapes IT job listings from PL+FR portals in the background, deduplicates (hashing + fuzzy matching), stores in SQLite, then filters/scores them with a cloud LLM (Gemini via OpenRouter) against the user's profile and agent-defined criteria. Outputs ranked HTML reports. UI via FastAPI + TailwindCSS + HTMX. Runs locally on Mac; optional migration to Oracle Cloud Free Tier.

**Cost:** Minimal pay-as-you-go API costs (typically <$1/month utilizing Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter; local Ollama client archived for potential future $0 cost offline runs).

### Scraper Workflows

#### JustJoinIT Scraper

The JustJoinIT scraper iterates through paginated API results, performs preliminary deduplication checks, fetches description details from the web (via JSON-LD), and implements specific rate limiting delays.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant SC as JJI Scraper
    participant API as JustJoinIT API
    participant WEB as JustJoinIT Web
    participant DB as SQLite

    loop For each page (up to max_pages)
        SC->>API: GET /v2/user-panel/offers
        API-->>SC: List of Offers
        loop For each Offer
            SC->>DB: Check Duplicate (URL or Title+Company)
            alt is duplicate URL
                SC->>SC: Skip Offer
            else is new URL
                SC->>WEB: GET /offers/{slug} (fetch JSON-LD)
                WEB-->>SC: Description
                SC->>SC: Sleep 0.5s (DETAIL_DELAY)
                SC->>DB: Re-check Duplicate (Full Content Hash)
                SC->>DB: Insert JobListing
            end
        end
        SC->>SC: Sleep 1.0s (REQUEST_DELAY) between pages
    end
```

#### NoFluffJobs Scraper

The NoFluffJobs scraper fetches a large batch in one request, groups multi-location duplicates in memory to save API calls, and then conservatively fetches job details with a massive 300-second delay per job to respect rate limits.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant SC as NFJ Scraper
    participant API as NoFluffJobs API
    participant DB as SQLite

    SC->>API: POST /api/search/posting (limit 500)
    API-->>SC: List of Postings
    SC->>SC: In-memory Dedup (merge locations by Title+Company)
    
    loop For each Unique Posting
        SC->>DB: Check Duplicate (URL or Title+Company)
        alt is duplicate URL
            SC->>SC: Skip Posting
        else is new URL
            SC->>API: GET /api/posting/{slug} (fetch details)
            API-->>SC: Details (Original Salary, Description)
            SC->>SC: Sleep 300s (DETAIL_DELAY)
            SC->>DB: Re-check Duplicate (Full Content Hash)
            SC->>DB: Insert JobListing
        end
    end
```

### Scoring Workflow

The scoring phase evaluates freshly scraped offers against the user's career profile using persona-based agents.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant DB as SQLite Database
    participant SE as Scoring Engine
    participant FS as Config Files
    participant OR as OpenRouter (Gemini)

    SE->>FS: Load config/profile.md & config/agents/*.md
    FS-->>SE: User profile & Agent rubrics
    SE->>DB: Fetch unscored, non-duplicate Job Listings
    DB-->>SE: List of new offers

    loop For each Agent
        loop For each unscored Offer
            SE->>SE: Build System Prompt (Agent Rubric)<br/>Build User Prompt (Profile + Offer)
            SE->>OR: POST /chat/completions<br/>(Enforces Strict JSON Schema)
            OR-->>SE: Parsed JSON { "score": float, "summary": str }
            SE->>DB: Insert AgentScore record
        end
    end
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅

#### Plan

1. Project init (`pyproject.toml`, `uv`, hatchling, pre-commit)
2. Pydantic Settings (`config.py`) + `.env`
3. SQLAlchemy models: `JobListing` (immutable), `ScrapingRun`
4. SQLite engine + session factory + Alembic migrations
5. 2-layer deduplication: URL + content hash (`dedup.py`)

### Phase 2: Scraper Engine

#### Plan

1. Implement scrapers per portal (priority order):
   - **JustJoinIT** — public API v2, pagination, JSON-LD description
   - **NoFluffJobs** — internal search API + detail endpoint, multilocation dedup
   - **Bulldogjob** — HTML scraping
   - **Welcome to the Jungle** — Playwright (SPA)
   - **FR portals:** APEC, LesJeudis, WeLoveDevs, ChooseYourBoss
2. Stealth middleware: User-Agent pool, fingerprint masking, random delays
3. Rate limiter: token bucket + jitter (8-25s base, micro/macro pauses)
4. Robots checker: parse and respect `robots.txt`
5. Entry point `main.py` — sequential scraper execution

#### Notes

- Portals scraped sequentially (single IP → staggered, not parallel). Random order each cycle.
- NFJ requires portal-specific multilocation dedup: grouping by (title, company) and merging cities before detail fetch to avoid redundant 5-min-delayed requests.
- Stealth middleware, rate limiter, and robots checker are NOT needed for JJI (public API) or NFJ (ultra-conservative 300s delay is sufficient). They become necessary when adding HTML-scraped portals (Bulldogjob, WTTJ, FR portals) which have bot detection and higher request volumes.

### Phase 3: Advanced Deduplication

#### Plan

1. Fuzzy cross-portal dedup (`rapidfuzz`, threshold 85%)
2. Flag `is_duplicate=true` for cross-portal matches (save, don't skip)
3. Optional: `sentence-transformers` embeddings + cosine similarity (layer 4)

#### Notes

- Current basic dedup (URL + content hash) is unlikely to catch cross-portal duplicates — URLs differ between portals, and descriptions/company names typically have formatting differences that break exact hash matching. Theoretically possible if content is byte-identical, but rare in practice.
- Fuzzy matching compares (company, title) of new offers against existing records. Unlike layers 1-2 which SKIP duplicates, fuzzy matches are SAVED with `is_duplicate=true` — cross-portal duplicates may contain different salary/description data worth keeping.
- Becomes valuable once ≥2 portals scrape overlapping offers (already possible with JJI + NFJ, but real value comes with more portals).

### Phase 4: LLM Scoring & Reports ✅

#### Plan

1. User profile file (`config/profile.md`) — education, experience, projects, aspirations
2. Create `AgentScore` SQLAlchemy model + Alembic migration:
   - `job_listing_id` (FK → JobListing)
   - `agent_name` (e.g., "ml-researcher", "ai-engineering")
   - `score` (Float, 0-1)
   - `summary` (Text — why this offer is relevant)
   - `scored_at`, `model_version`
   - Unique constraint on (job_listing_id, agent_name)
3. Agent definitions as .md files in `config/agents/` — describes what kind of offers to select. Scoring prompt combines profile + agent instructions + offer → score (0-1) + summary.
4. OpenRouter/Gemini API client + retry/backoff logic + response formatting + response healing

#### Notes

- Migrated to Cloud LLM (`google/gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenRouter). The pipeline utilizes OpenRouter's strict JSON schema mode and response-healing features to ensure robust scoring results.
- ~200 offers/day processed very rapidly compared to local execution (sub-second or low-second response times).
- Extremely low cost: Gemini-2.5-flash is highly cost-efficient, keeping monthly costs negligible.
- Ollama client kept as an archived fallback in the codebase for potential fully-offline or self-hosted deployment.
- No separate CV parser needed — profile is a plain .md file read directly.
- Multi-agent design: adding a new agent = new .md instruction file in `config/agents/` + scoring run. No migration needed.
- Re-scoring one agent (e.g., after prompt change) doesn't affect other agents' results.
- Best models (open) for this task:

| Model | Context Window | Deployment / VRAM | Main Use Case | Architectural Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Qwen3-32B** | 131K | Locally (1x GPU 24GB) / API | Feature extraction and stable JSON output | High information density, SOTA instruction-following |
| **Qwen3-8B** | 32K | Locally (Oracle A1 24GB) | Daily scoring and summaries | High quality vs footprint, fits in Oracle Free Tier |
| **DeepSeek V4-Flash** | 1M | Cheap API ($0.27/1M) | Mass screening and fast filtering | Architecture oriented towards agentic throughput, no *Lost-in-the-Middle* |
| **DeepSeek-R1** | 128K | API / Multi-GPU | Deep gap analysis of profile and offer | Native *Chain-of-Thought* (unlocks hidden reasoning) |
| **Llama 4 Scout** | 10M | vLLM cluster / API | Processing entire sites with DOM/PDF structure | Linear attention scaling, ultra-low TTFT |

### Phase 5: Web UI

#### Plan

1. Static HTML report with top offers ranked by score + summaries
2. FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX + TailwindCSS (+ DaisyUI)
3. Views: Dashboard, Listings (filtering/sorting), Reports, Settings
4. Charts: Plotly — tech trends, salary ranges, % remote

#### Notes

### Phase 6: Automation & Deployment

#### Plan

1. APScheduler — staggered scraping cycles (every 3h, random portal order, 10-30 min pauses)
2. Health checks + monitoring
3. `launchd` plist (macOS auto-start) / Docker (optional)
4. Optional migration: Oracle Cloud Free Tier (ARM 4 cores, 24 GB RAM, $0/month)

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

| # | Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 2026-04 | **SQLite** as database | Zero config, sufficient for ~200 listings/day. PostgreSQL migration possible via SQLAlchemy. |
| 2 | 2026-04 | **2-layer dedup** (URL + content hash) instead of planned 3 layers | Fuzzy matching only makes sense with multiple portals. Layers 1-2 suffice for MVP. |
| 3 | 2026-04 | **Content hash** = SHA256(title + company + description), not location | Description better identifies uniqueness. Multilocation offers have identical description but different locations. |
| 4 | 2026-05 | **JJI description** from JSON-LD (schema.org JobPosting) | Simpler than DOM parsing. Stable format. |
| 5 | 2026-05 | **NFJ salaryCurrency/salaryPeriod** = PLN/month | Doesn't filter — only converts displayed amount. Without them API returns 0 results. |
| 6 | 2026-05 | **NFJ detail delay** = 300s (~12 req/h) | Conservative limit. `robots.txt` disallows `/api/`. Safety > speed. |
| 7 | 2026-05 | **NFJ multilocation dedup** before detail fetch | Group by (title, company). Without this: 3× more detail requests = 3× longer. |
| 8 | 2026-05 | **Sequential** scraper execution (not parallel) | Single IP, code simplicity. Scheduler (APScheduler) in Phase 6. |
| 9 | 2026-06 | **Ollama via HTTP API** (localhost) for LLM access | Easier to manage than loading models directly via `transformers`. Handles model lifecycle and quantization. |
| 10 | 2026-06 | **Agent extensibility** via `.md` files in `config/agents/` | Adding a new scoring agent only requires adding a markdown file. No code changes or DB migrations needed for new personas. |
| 11 | 2026-06 | **UniqueConstraint** on `(job_listing_id, agent_name)` | Ensures an offer is only scored once per agent. Prevents duplicate calls and ensures idempotent scoring runs. |
| 12 | 2026-06 | **Scoring only NEW offers** | Efficiency: ~30-50 min for ~200 new offers daily. Scoring already stored offers is unnecessary. |
| 13 | 2026-06 | **Oracle Cloud ARM (24GB RAM)** for deployment | Qwen3-8B requires ~6GB. Oracle's free tier is the only one sufficient for local LLM execution. |
| 14 | 2026-07 | **Migration to Cloud LLM (Gemini-2.5-flash via OpenRouter)** | Cloud-based Gemini-2.5-flash offers superior intelligence, strict JSON schema compliance, and response healing at negligible pay-as-you-go costs ($0.075 / 1M tokens), while eliminating local GPU/RAM hardware requirements. |
| 15 | 2026-07 | **Preserve Ollama client as archived fallback** | Retains local offline option (`ollama_client.py`) in the codebase for potential future local-only execution. |
| 16 | 2026-07 | **Consolidated setup and guide** | Replaced multiple OS-specific script variants with a single parameterizable `setup.sh` and a unified `docs/setup-guide.md` to simplify maintenance and VM/local developer onboarding. |
